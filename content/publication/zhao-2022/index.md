abstract: The automatic identification of urban functional regions (UFRs) is crucial
  for urban planning and management. A key issue involved in URF classification is
  to properly determine the basic functional units, for which popular practices are
  usually based upon existing land use boundaries or road networks. Such practices
  suffer from the unavailability of existing datasets, leading to difficulty in large-scale
  mapping. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a method to automatically
  obtain functional units for URF classification using high-resolution remote sensing
  images. We develop a context-aware segmentation network to simultaneously extract
  buildings and road networks from remote sensing images. The extracted road networks
  are used for partitioning functional units, upon which five main building types
  are distinguished considering building height, morphology, and geometry. Finally,
  the UFRs are classified according to the distribution of building types. We conducted
  experiments using a GaoFen-2 satellite image with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m
  acquired in Fuzhou, China. Experimental results showed that the proposed segmentation
  network performed better than other convolutional neural network segmentation methods
  (i.e., PSPNet, Deeplabv3+, DANet, and JointNet), with an increase of F1-score up
  to 1.37% and 1.19% for road and building extraction, respectively. Results also
  showed that the residential regions, accounting for most of the urban areas, identified
  by the proposed method had a user accuracy of 94%, implying the promise of the proposed
  method for deriving the spatial units and the types of urban functional regions.
