abstract: Streets are a crucial part of the built environment, and their layouts,
  the street patterns, are widely researched and contribute to a quantitative understanding
  of urban morphology. However, traditional street pattern analysis only considers
  a few broadly defined characteristics. It uses administrative boundaries and grids
  as units of analysis that fail to encompass the diversity and complexity of street
  networks. To address these challenges, this research proposes a machine learning-based
  approach to automatically recognise street patterns that employs an adaptive analysis
  unit based on street-based local areas (SLAs). SLAs use a network partitioning technique
  that can adapt to distinct street networks, making it particularly suitable for
  different urban contexts. By calculating several streetsâ€™ network metrics and performing
  a hierarchical clustering method, streets with similar characters are grouped under
  the same street pattern. A case study is carried out in six cities worldwide. The
  results show that street pattern types are rather diverse and hierarchical, and
  categorising them into clearly demarcated taxonomy is challenging. The study derives
  a set of new morphometrics-based street patterns with four major types that resemble
  conventional street patterns and eleven sub-types to significantly increase their
  diversity for broader coverage of urban morphology. The new patterns capture urban
  structural differences across cities, such as the urban-suburban division and the
  number of urban centres present. In conclusion, the proposed machine learning-based
  morphometric street pattern to characterise urban morphology has an enhanced ability
  to encompass more information from the built environment while maintaining the intuitiveness
  of using patterns.
