This brings new demand for planning support systems to simulate and analyse the urban spatial structure in terms of polycentricity under various urban policy scenarios. With the help of emerging urban data, urban simulation techniques, and network science, this study proposes a workflow to simulate the urban spatial structure with spatial interaction as a part of the planning support system. Using Singapore as a case study, this study has explored the resulting urban spatial structure with four employment distribution strategies. The results suggest that planning practices impact urban spatial structure and its spatial interaction by redistributing urban morphological elements, such as employment in this study. Also, our results show that the physical urban spatial structure and spatial interaction are closely related. These results reinforce the role of urban planning practice to achieve a more sustainable and coherent urban built environment. Through this empirical evidence, our workflow exemplifies the potential of the planning support system to help urban planners and governments understand their urban policy regarding urban polycentricity.},

   abstract = {Abstr act. Street patterns are planar street layouts in a given urban area, which serve as tools for researchers and urban planners to comprehend the structure of urban environments. Nonetheless, the task of mapping street patterns for extensive inter-city studies remains daunting due to the lack of consistency in manual identification methods. With recent technological advancements and data accessibility , new avenues have opened for data-driven techniques in mapping street patterns. This study proposes an innovative framework that employs open data platforms and data processing methods, including network science and supervised machine learning, to map street patterns in cities across the globe effortlessly. Case studies were applied to six cities worldwide and made two key observations from the resulting maps. Firstly, the spatial distribution of street patterns mirrors theurban spatial structure within a city. Secondly, the innate differences between cities become apparent. This study is confident that the novel methodology not only unveils the urban spatial structure across diversecities but can also be employed to investigate the connection between urban built form and urban activities.},

   abstract = {Streets are a crucial part of the built environment, and their layouts, the street patterns, are widely researched and contribute to a quantitative understanding of urban morphology. However, traditional street pattern analysis only considers a few broadly defined characteristics. It uses administrative boundaries and grids as units of analysis that fail to encompass the diversity and complexity of street networks. To address these challenges, this research proposes a machine learning-based approach to automatically recognise street patterns that employs an adaptive analysis unit based on street-based local areas (SLAs). SLAs use a network partitioning technique that can adapt to distinct street networks, making it particularly suitable for different urban contexts. By calculating several streetsâ€™ network metrics and performing a hierarchical clustering method, streets with similar characters are grouped under the same street pattern. A case study is carried out in six cities worldwide. The results show that street pattern types are rather diverse and hierarchical, and categorising them into clearly demarcated taxonomy is challenging. The study derives a set of new morphometrics-based street patterns with four major types that resemble conventional street patterns and eleven sub-types to significantly increase their diversity for broader coverage of urban morphology. The new patterns capture urban structural differences across cities, such as the urban-suburban division and the number of urban centres present. In conclusion, the proposed machine learning-based morphometric street pattern to characterise urban morphology has an enhanced ability to encompass more information from the built environment while maintaining the intuitiveness of using patterns.},

   abstract = {The automatic identification of urban functional regions (UFRs) is crucial for urban planning and management. A key issue involved in URF classification is to properly determine the basic functional units, for which popular practices are usually based upon existing land use boundaries or road networks. Such practices suffer from the unavailability of existing datasets, leading to difficulty in large-scale mapping. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a method to automatically obtain functional units for URF classification using high-resolution remote sensing images. We develop a context-aware segmentation network to simultaneously extract buildings and road networks from remote sensing images. The extracted road networks are used for partitioning functional units, upon which five main building types are distinguished considering building height, morphology, and geometry. Finally, the UFRs are classified according to the distribution of building types. We conducted experiments using a GaoFen-2 satellite image with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m acquired in Fuzhou, China. Experimental results showed that the proposed segmentation network performed better than other convolutional neural network segmentation methods (i.e., PSPNet, Deeplabv3+, DANet, and JointNet), with an increase of F1-score up to 1.37% and 1.19% for road and building extraction, respectively. Results also showed that the residential regions, accounting for most of the urban areas, identified by the proposed method had a user accuracy of 94%, implying the promise of the proposed method for deriving the spatial units and the types of urban functional regions.},

   abstract = {<p>This study introduces a machine learning-based framework for mapping street patterns in urban morphology, offering an objective, scalable approach that transcends traditional methodologies. Focusing on six diverse cities, the research employed supervised machine learning to classify street networks into gridiron, organic, hybrid, and cul-de-sac patterns with the street-based local area (SLA) as the unit of analysis. Utilising quantitative street metrics and GIS, the study analysed the urban form through the random forest method, which reveals the predictive features of urban patterns and enables a deeper understanding of the spatial structures of cities. The findings showed distinctive spatial structures, such as ring formations and urban cores, indicating stages of urban development and socioeconomic narratives. It also showed that the unit of analysis has a major impact on the identification and study of street patterns. Concluding that machine learning is a critical tool in urban morphology, the research suggests that future studies should expand this framework to include more cities and urban elements. This would enhance the predictive modelling of urban growth and inform sustainable, human-centric urban planning. The implications of this study are significant for policymakers and urban planners seeking to harness data-driven insights for the development of cities.</p>},
